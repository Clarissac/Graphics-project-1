# Graphics-project-1
This project is for computer graphics, professor Palmer.
This project was incredibly hard and although it doesn't appear like it I did work on it all week and a half that was given to us. 
I didn't upload my repository because I was scared to use it as github was new to me, my classmate Ashley showed me how to use it but I forgot how to use it and I didn't wanted to ask again.
I met with classmates almost every day to work on this project but it wasn't enough as I still couldn't finish the project.
